        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This Italian Homemade Lasagna is made with béchamel white sauce (no
          ricotta) and a flavorful homemade red sauce.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Sauces: The white sauce is a homemade béchamel (and could be
            replaced with ricotta if you prefer), and taking a few extra minutes
            to make the red sauce, rather than bottled pasta sauce, is so worth
            the huge improvement in taste!
          </li>
          <li>
            Freezer Friendly: I always make a double batch and freeze the second
            pan for another day. See recipe notes for how to freeze lasagna.
          </li>

            Family Favorite: lasagna recipes are a staple in most peoples recipe
            boxes, but this is easily the best lasagna recipe!

      <section class="Instructions">
        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>Make the Red Sauce:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Brown meat: In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and sausage
            over medium-high heat, breaking the meat apart into pieces with a
            wooden spoon. When cooked through, remove the grease.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sauté Veggies: In the same skillet over medium-high heat, add olive
            oil. When oil is hot, add the garlic, stirring constantly for 30
            seconds. Add the onion, spinach and bell pepper. Continue cooking on
            medium-high heat until the vegetables are softened, about 2-3
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from heat and transfer them to the same food processor. Pulse
            several times until they're nearly puréed. Return mixture to the
            skillet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add Tomato sauce and tomato paste and stir to combine. Add the diced
            tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir.
            Cover and allow the sauce to simmer for about 20-30 minutes on low
            heat, stirring occasionally. Right before using the red sauce in the
            lasagna, stir in the reserved crumbled ground beef and sausage, and
            fresh basil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook Pasta: While the red sauce simmers boil the lasagna noodles for
            half the time suggested on the box. Drain into a large colander and
            sprinkle them with a tiny bit of olive oil to keep them from
            sticking together.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Make the White Sauce:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the butter to a medium size saucepan or large skillet. Over
            medium heat. Once melted, add the flour, stirring constantly to
            combine 2 minutes. Gradually add in the milk, whisking until smooth.
            Season with salt and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook over medium heat, whisking often, so it doesn't burn on the
            bottom, until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Assemble Lasagna:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 9X13-inch baking
            pan with cooking spray. Keep in mind that there will be 3 layers of
            lasagna, so mentally split the sauces into thirds as you layer them
            to make sure you have enough at the end.
          </li>
          <li>
            Layer: Start by layering the bottom of your greased pan with 3
            lasagna noodles. Spread the red sauce over the noodles, followed by
            the white sauce, Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses, spreading all to
            the edges. Top with another layer of noodles, then red sauce, white
            sauce, Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat: Add the final layer of noodles, then red sauce, white sauce
            and cheeses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake for 30 minutes. Allow the lasagna to sit for 15-20 minutes
            before serving.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve with garlic bread or homemade bread sticks and a green salad.
          </li>
        </ol>
