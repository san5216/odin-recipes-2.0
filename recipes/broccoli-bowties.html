        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>7 ingredients. 3 of them are seasoning. You do the math.</p>
        <p>
          This is my favorite substitute for “real” dinner when I'm tired and
          hungry. I usually have all these ingredients on hand, and it only
          takes minutes to throw together. Sometimes, I'll boil extra pasta,
          freeze the leftovers in single serving freezer bags, then I can just
          toss the frozen pasta and broccoli into a bowl and microwave for a
          minute or two until hot.

          <li>1 pound frozen broccoli florets</li>
          <li>3 Tablespoons butter</li>
          <li>3 Tablespoons grated Parmesan</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bring a pot of water to a boil, then add the pasta. Boil until the
            pasta is al dente (7-10 minutes). Add the frozen broccoli florets to
            the boiling pasta water, turn off the heat, and let sit for 1-2
            minutes, or until the broccoli is tender-crisp. Drain the pasta and
            broccoli in a colander.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the pasta and broccoli back to the pot (with the heat off)
            or to a bowl and add the butter. Toss until the butter has melted
            and coated everything. Add the Parmesan, salt, freshly cracked
            pepper, and red pepper flakes, then toss to coat again. Taste and
            adjust seasoning as needed. Serve immediately.
